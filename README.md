# Data Source
The data was sourced from solar power generation reports by Energinet, the Danish national transmission system operator for electricity. It is an independent public enterprise owned by the Danish state under the Ministry of Climate and Energy. 
The data has been extracted from a website run by Energinet at the following link where time series data is publicly available.

For the purpose of this simulation we use data for dates between 8 August 2019 to 30 August 2019. The solar irradiance being almost nil for around 14 h in a day, we use data for times between 8 AM to 5 PM.

# How to run
You can easily run the included ipython notebook on Jupyter or Google Colab.
